## Background & Motivation

Web-based applications are becoming the most common way to build a digital capability accessible to a mass audience. While there are modern tools that help us build these rapidly, it's important to understand the fundamental JavaScript-based technology and architectures that exist, both to gain a deeper understanding for when these skills may be needed, but also to simply understand the mechanics of fundamental JS. Even when working with a high level framework like ReactJS, understanding (in-concept) the code that it is transpiled to will ensure you're a more well rounded web-based engineer.

The built web-based application is required to be a single page app (SPA). Single page apps give websites an "app-like feeling", and are characterised by their use of a single full load of an initial HTML page, and then using AJAX/fetch to dynamically manipulate the DOM without ever requiring a full page reload. In this way, SPAs are generated, rendered, and updated using JavaScript. Because SPAs don’t require a user to navigate away from a page to do anything, they retain a degree of user and application state. In short, this means you will only ever have `index.html` as your HTML page, and that any sense of "moving between pages" will just be modifications of the DOM.
